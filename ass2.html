Fulfilling the long felt intellectual call for a national institution to conduct study and research both at home and abroad in these ancient languages and to promote a greater sense of fraternity and spirit of integration among the speakers of the major Dravidian languages in the South the Government of Andhra Pradesh has benevolently come forward to establish Dravidian University through a Legislative Act in October 1997 involving the support of the other Southern States, <em>Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.</em>
</p><p>It is located at a trilingual junction at Kuppam, Chittor Dstrict in the South-Western tip of A.P, which is only 4 kms away from Karnataka, 8 kms from Tamil Nadu and of course very close to Kerala border, which is less than 4.5 hrs drive. The principle objective of the establishment of the Dravidian University is to promote integrated studies on the common heritage of the Dravidian speakers facilitating a strong perception of oneness among them.
